I'm a data scientist and statistician, specializing in risk quantification and probability assessment. I currently work for FanDuel as a data scientist on the Sports Modeling and Innovation team. My educational background is in actuarial sciences and applied statistics. I have experience working in the insurance, professional sports, consumer packaged goods, and betting industries. 

Here I will post about things that spark my curiosity. I imagine my posts might not be of direct utility to many people, but perhaps they can spark an idea or help one think of a topic in a different way.

Beyond the scope of my professional life, I am a husband and father who enjoys going for walks with my family, cooking, and mowing the lawn.
