    "While this may be an admittedly poetic take on the subject, differential equations do have important applications in physics, engineering, and [computer science](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366).\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exaclty is a differential equation? Well, per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation):\n",
    "> \"In mathematics, a differential equation is an equation that relates one or more functions and their derivatives.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems fairly straight forward right? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is desireable to find an explicit *solution* to these differential equations, or rather, a function who is related to its own derivative in the way described by the differential equation. But sometimes (basically almost all the time), they can be incredibly difficult or impossible to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most introductory courses in ordinary differntial equations (Differential equations that don't involve partial derivatives, we refer to them as ODEs) will introduce several specific types of ODEs for which an explicit solution can be found (such as linear ODEs and harmonic oscilators), as well as techniques to solve simpler ones (such as [seperation of variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_variables) and [integrating factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrating_factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the differential equations that we don't yet have a known method for solving, we turn to numerical approximation algorithms to give us an idea of what the behavior of the solution is like. These numerical methods can be computationally arduous, so it is preferable to write code to compute them for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will introduce a three different approximation algorithms written in python. These are ([Euler's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method), [Heun's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method), and the [Runge-Kutta Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge–Kutta_methods)).

We have a differential equation that models the change in a variable with respect to time, and our goal is to explicitly describe the variable as a function of time that is governed by the rate of change described by our differential equation. Recall that this is generally very difficult (if possible) for most differential equations, so we must come up with a reasonable way to estimate the behavior of our variable with respect to time.\n",

The method achieves this in a stepwise fashion, where it approximates the value of the solution at points in time seperated by a constant time interval. These intervals are determined by the number of steps in our algorithm. In our case, we are using 10 steps between time 0 and time 2 by approximating the vaue of our solution at the following time points [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0].\n",

    "It is interesting to observe how close the approximations were at each time step. As we move forward, we will be able to compare more sophisticated algorithms to Euler's Method and see how the accuracy improves.\n",

    "## (ii) Heun's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Heun's Method is very similar to Euler's Method in the sense that it is using the slopes from our differential equation at specific time points to approximate the values of the solution, but there is one key difference.\n",
    "Recall in Euler's Method how we used the following equation to approximate the value of the solution at an aribtrary time point: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{t+1} = y_t + m_t*dt \\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where dt is the change in time, and m_t is the value of the differential equation at the given time and value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m_t = f(t, y_t) = -2*t*y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in Heun's Method is that it uses the average of the slope at time t and time t+1 to approximate the value of the solution at time t. The recursive equation looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{t+1} = y_t + \\frac{(m_t + m_{t+1})}{2} *dt \\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we know what the value of the slope is at time t+1 if we don't yet know the value of the solution at time t? Well, we can use Euler's Method! In this algorithm, we utilize Euler's Method to move one time step forward (t+1), calculate the slope at that time point, and then go back to time t and use the average of our slope at t and T+1 to calculate the value of our solution at time t+1. \n",
    "\n",
    "To paint a better picture of what is going on, I like to use the analogy of the Rectangle Rule vs the Trapazoid Rule for approximating integrals (essentially our whole task is to approximate the integral of a derivative). Euler's Method is analogous to a Rectangle Rule and Heun's Method is analogous to the Trapazoid Rule. For a refresher on what I am referencing here, you can read more on numerical integration techniques [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration).\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that can seem confusing. I have outlined the steps below for your reference to hopefully make the process more clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### STEPS FOR APPROXIMATING SOLUTION VALUES USING HEUN'S METHOD\n",
    "1. Calculate the value of the slope at time t from the differential equation.\n",
    "2. Use the slope from (1) to calculate the value of the solution at time t+1 using Euler's Method.\n",
    "3. Calculate the value of the slope at time t+1 from the differential equation using the value approximated from (2).\n",
    "4. Go back to time t and approximate the value of the solution at time t+1 using the average of the slopes calculated from (1) and (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heun's Method Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The function for our Heun's Method algorithm is very similar to the function we used for our Euler's Method algorithm, (this makes sense considering the two algorithms are effectively the same sans one term). The additions we have to make are in our *y_approx* function. We add a y_k_m term which is our approximation of the solution at time t+1 using our slope m, the m2 term which is our slope approximated at time t+1, and then we add the average of m and m2 in the returned value."

    "The improvment in accuracy is even evident in the graph shown above. The green line approximates the black solution line much better than the red line we saw above from our plot of the Euler's Method approximation\n",

    "## (iii) Runge-Kutta Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Runge-Kutta metheds area  class of approximation methods developed by mathematicians Carl Runge and Wilhelm Kutta. When one refers to the \"Runge-Kutta Method\", they are most likely refereing to the 4th order method, commonly refered to as \"RK4\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Runge-Kutta method takes a page out of the Heun Method's playbook by again using an average of several slopes, but instead of using an arithmetic average of 2 slopes it uses a weighted average of 4 slopes. The four slopes are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume an initial starting point of t_0 and a step size of h.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slope 1: (denoted m)\n",
    "- The first slope is simply the value of the differential equation at t_0 and the value (or approximated value) of the solution at t_0. (Same slope used in Euler's Method)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Slope 2: (denoted n)\n",
    "- The second slope is a little more involved. It uses the slope m, but then uses that slope to approximate the value of the solution at the time point t_0 + h/2 (so halfway between t_0 and t_0 + h). The second slope n is then the value of the differential equation evaluated at t_0 + h/2 and the approximated value of the solution at t_0 + h/2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Slope 3: (denoted q)\n",
    "- The third slope is similar to the second slope in that it is calculated from evaluating the ODE at t_0 + h/2, but it gets there a little bit differently. It uses the slope n (the one calculated in step 2) at the t_0 to project out to t_0 + h/2, where the third slope q is calculated as the value of the differention given the value of the solution just calculated at t_0 + h/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slope 4: (denoted p)\n",
    "- The fourth slope is calculated at time t + h (end of the interval). The value of the solution is approximated using the slope q and the time point t_0 to approximate the value of the solution at time t_0 + h. The differential equation is then evaluated at time t_0 + h with the value of the approximated solution to get the final slope, p.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will generate a plot to give a visual of what these slopes represent. As a bonus, we can use the code we write below to help create our Runge-Kutta approximation function!"

    "## Global Truncation Error of Euler's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Global truncation error is defined as the error at a the final time point. In our case, it is the error at time 2. Consider our approximation for the solution's value using Euler's Method. At time 0 we have our initial conditions so there is no error. When we project out to the next time step, we are approximating the value of the solution using the slope at time 0 and introduce error (called the *Local Truncation Error*). Then on top of that, we use this approximation to calculate the slope at the this time step (more local truncation error) and approximate the solution's value at the next time step (add on some more local truncation error for good measure). The additive result of all these compounding errors is called the \"Global Truncation Error\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the effect that the number of steps has on the global trunction error, let's loop over different step counts from 10 to 500 by 10 and calculate the error at each number. Let's make a simple plot to help us think about what is really happening."

    "As I am sure you can imagine, this is barely scratching the surface on numerical techniques to evaluate ODE's, let alone all the other interesting topics surrounding ODE's (my personal favorite is the application of the Laplace Transform to solve ODE's). If you found this work interesting, I highly encourage you to dive into other recourses on the topic. I used Blanchard's text book (ISBN-13: [978-0495561989](https://www.chegg.com/textbooks/differential-equations-with-de-tools-printed-access-card-4th-edition-9781133109037-1133109039)) as my primary recourse to learn about differential equations. The text is very well written and easy to follow. Other recourses that I have found useful include online courses on Udemy, such as [this one](https://www.udemy.com/course/a-complete-first-course-in-differential-equations/). I encourage anyone to defer to the recources that are more alinged with their learning style.\n",

    "Lastly, I want to sincerely thank you for taking the time to read through my small project on numerical approximations for solutions of first order ODE's. I found the process of investigating these techniques and creating a practical demonstration to be incredibly rewarding. If you have any questions, comments, or suggested improvements, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at yahr.mason@gmail.com"
